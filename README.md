# Github pull requests filter by labels plugin

This plugin is inspired by the [Github additional traits plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-additional-traits-plugin).
It provides filters for:
 - Filter pull requests by exactly matching all labels defined in the trait.
 - Black pull requests by matching any labels defined in the trait.
